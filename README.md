# About Me
> Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value. - Albert Einstein

My name is **Peng Peng**.
Currently, I am a research assistant with a master degree in engineering mechanics at *the School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering*.

My interests include partial differential equations (PDE) and fluid dynamics.
I love to explore these two topics from both analytical (manifold) and numerical (potential flow, computational fluid dynamics) aspects.
