## ABOUT ME
My name is Peng Peng, and I am a Master‚Äôs student in Engineering Mechanics at the School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a deep passion for mathematics, particularly in areas such as nonlinear differential equations, perturbation methods, calculus of variations, dynamical systems, and chaos theory.

**Currently, I am looking for a PhD opportunity in Fluid Mechanics**, and am eager to deepen my understanding of partial differential equations and manifold theory during my PhD studies.

## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
During my Master‚Äôs studies, I focused on the sloshing dynamics of liquid tanks and Faraday waves. My thesis, titled ‚ÄúInvestigations of Sloshing Characteristics in a Two-dimensional Rectangular Tank Under Coupled Pitch and Heave Excitations,‚Äù allowed me to explore theoretical, experimental, and numerical aspects of fluid dynamics. Using Wolfram Mathematica, I derived linear potential flow solutions for sloshing through the separation of variables method. For nonlinear Faraday waves, I applied Floquet theory and harmonic balance perturbation methods with Maxima, a computer algebra system, to solve Mathieu equations, identifying unstable regions for sloshing flows under vertical excitations. I also conducted sloshing experiments on a three-degree-of-freedom shaking table, using Python and MATLAB to analyze pressure data and automatically identify wave profiles through AI models. Additionally, I employed OpenFOAM (C++) to simulate sloshing flows under higher-order frequencies and larger displacements, and I used Blender to visualize and render turbulent flows. These experiences have strengthened my ability to analyze and solve nonlinear hydrodynamic problems.
