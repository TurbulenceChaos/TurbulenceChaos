## ABOUT ME
My name is Peng Peng, and I am a Masterâ€™s student in Engineering Mechanics at the School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a deep passion for mathematics, particularly in areas such as nonlinear differential equations, perturbation methods, calculus of variations, dynamical systems, and chaos theory.

**Currently, I am looking for a PhD opportunity in Fluid Mechanics**, and am eager to deepen my understanding of partial differential equations and manifold theory during my PhD studies.

## SKILLS & INTERESTS
**Technical Skills:**
1. **OpenFOAM/C++/STAR-CCM+** â€“ Use the finite volume method to simulate sloshing flows.
2. **Python/MATLAB** â€“ Analyze experimental data and apply AI models to automatically identify wave profiles.
3. **Wolfram Mathematica/Maxima CAS** â€“ Study Faraday waves using the perturbation method.
4. **Emacs/LaTeX** â€“ Create presentations.
5. **Abaqus/Patran/Nastran** â€“ Apply the finite element method to evaluate the structural strength of offshore platforms.
6. **SolidWorks/CATIA/HyperMesh/ICEM** â€“ Model and mesh offshore structures.
7. **Paraview/Blender** â€“ Render turbulent flow simulations.

**Research Interests:** Sloshing flows, Faraday waves, Wave energy converter, Turbulent flows, PDEs, Asymptotic methods and perturbation theory
