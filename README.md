## ABOUT ME
My name is Peng Peng, and I am a Master's student in Engineering Mechanics at the School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong passion for mathematics, particularly in nonlinear differential equations, perturbation theory, calculus of variations, dynamical systems, and chaos theory.

## Technical Skills
- **OpenFOAM/C++/STAR-CCM+** - Use the finite volume method to simulate sloshing flows.
- **Python/MATLAB/Julia** - Analyze experimental data and apply AI models to automatically identify wave profiles.
- **Wolfram Mathematica/Maxima CAS** - Study Faraday waves using the harmonic balance perturbation method.
- **Abaqus/Patran/Nastran** - Apply the finite element method to evaluate the structural strength of offshore platforms and marines.
- **SolidWorks/CATIA/HyperMesh/ICEM** - Model and mesh offshore structures and marines.
- **Paraview/Blender** - Render turbulent flow simulations.
- **Emacs Lisp/LaTeX** - Create presentations.

## Research Interests
- Sloshing flows, Faraday waves, turbulent flows
- Fluid-structure interactions, flow-induced vibrations and control
- Wave energy converter, Wind Turbine Floaters
- Computational fluid dynamics, machine learning and deep learning
- Partial differential equations, numerical method, asymptotic and perturbation theory
