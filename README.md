## ABOUT ME
My name is Peng Peng, and I am a Masterâ€™s student in Engineering Mechanics at the School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a deep passion for mathematics, particularly in areas such as nonlinear differential equations, perturbation methods, calculus of variations, dynamical systems, and chaos theory.

**Currently, I am looking for a PhD opportunity in Fluid Mechanics**, and am eager to deepen my understanding of partial differential equations and manifold theory during my PhD studies.

## SKILLS & INTERESTS
**Technical Skills:**
1. OpenFOAM/C++/STAR-CCM+ (Use Finite volume method to calculate sloshing flows)
2. Python/MATLAB (Analyze experimental data and use AI model to automatically identify wave profiles)
3. Wolfram Mathematica/Maxima (Analyze Faraday waves with perturbation method)
4. Emacs/LaTeX (Make presentations)
5. Abaqus/MSC Patran/Nastran (Use Finite element method to calculate strength of offshore structures)
6. SolidWorks/CATIA/HyperMesh/ICEM (offshore structures modeling and meshing)
7. Paraview/Blender (Render turbulent flowsï¼‰

**Research Interests:** Sloshing flows, Faraday waves, Wave energy converter, Turbulent flows, PDEs, Asymptotic perturbation method
